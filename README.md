# PresentHunt
PresentHunt is a Minecraft plugin that makes it possible to search for 'presents' in a server. We used it as a Christmas Minigame for our lobby. Where we used playerheads with the skin of a present. It displays particles around the present. And when a player collected all the presents, it gives a snowball that players can use to fly around the lobby.

This plugin was part of the [ScoutCraft project](https://github.com/ScoutCraft-Scouting-Nederland), which was the Minecraft server for Dutch scouts during the Corona pandemic. It's developed by the Dev-group, which was a project to make it possible for members of our community to develop a plugin together with the experienced developers of ScoutCraft.

This plugins has official support for Minecraft 1.17

## Features
* A text above the item bar which shows how many presents a player found and how many there are
* A cool collectible if a player found all the presents
* Practical admin interface to quickly add and remove presents with a wand
* Multi-language support
